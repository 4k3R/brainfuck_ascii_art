# Brainfuck ASCII Art

Sample project developed using Brainfuck programming language. It takes only few minutes to understand Brainfuck. Clearly understand how Hello World! works in Brainfuck, then the rest will be easy. ASCII art generated by my code.

### Brainfuck description on Wikipedia

> Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism.

> The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.

### 8 commands of Brainfuck

| Character   | Meaning  |
|---|---|
| > | increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right). |
| < | decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left). |
| + | increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer. |
| - | decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer. |
| . | output the byte at the data pointer. |
| , | accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer. |
| [ | if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command. |
| ] | if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command. |
